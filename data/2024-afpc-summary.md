<details><summary>Answer</summary>
    The password to #ircpuzzles-2024-afpc-A2 was "shamirssecretsharingsna", instead of "shamirssecretsharingsnake". Turns out keys are limited to 23 characters on libera, who knew?
</details>

<details markdown="1"><summary>Walkthrough</summary>

Snake picture thanks to Colleen O'Dell, aka [StarGlade](https://pixabay.com/users/starglade-768093/).

The lost picture poster has 10 secret messages hidden in it.

1. The filename, `U2hhbWlyIGNhbid0IHJlYWQ=` decodes as base64 to **Shamir can't read**
2. In the EXIF of the JPG is hidden the comment **Shamir is actually twin brothers**
3. At the end of the file is the plain text string **Shamir is three kids in a trenchcoat**
4. (error) The four stripes at the bottom of the snake are colored. Their actual hex values are erroneously one off in some cases due to JPEG compression. Their hex values should instead have been: #416469 #486174 #65734B #697474 #656E73. In ASCII, this hex decodes as **AdiHatesKittens**.
5. Along the snake‚Äôs top belly stripes is hidden morse code: `... .... .- -- .. .-. / .-- . - ... / .... .. ... / -... . -..` decodes as **SHAMIR / WETS / HIS / BED**
6. Overlapping three sets of mystery glyphs reveals the text **Adi is the crown prince in disguise**
7. Written very small in grey text on the snake‚Äôs tail is **Shamir is afraid of mice**
8. Hidden in dark blue dots in the snake‚Äôs right eye is the text **HeIsPregnant**. (a reference to a previous year's goldbug puzzle)
9. The snake‚Äôs speech decodes in binary as: **ImHisPetSnake**
10. The snake's speech has groups of S's separated by spaces. The group lengths decode to letters (A=1,B=2): **Adi Shamir‚Äôs**

Note: [Shamir‚Äôs Secret Sharing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamir%27s_secret_sharing) is a method invented by Adi Shamir to share a secret using (say) any 4 out of 10 messages.

Who is S.S.S.S.? It‚Äôs this snake spilling all of Adi Shamir‚Äôs deepest secrets.

The key is "Shamir'sSecretSharingSna[ke]".

<details><summary>Answer</summary>
    The password to #ircpuzzles-2024-afpc-A3 was "prose"
</details>

<details markdown="1"><summary>Walkthrough</summary>

The player is thrown into a text adventure with a series of passages. Hidden in the passages are 5 shapes drawn on the floor, 10 plaques, and a waiver.

The layout of the passages is as follows:
```
                        [H]
                        [ ]
                        [ ]
         [D][C][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]
            [ ]         [ ]
      [G][ ][ ][ ][ ]   [ ]
   [Z]      [ ]
[P][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]
   [ ]      [ ]
   [ ]   [F][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]
   [ ]      [*]
   [ ]
   [A][ ][I][ ][ ][ ]
         [ ]
         [ ]
   [M][ ][ ][ ][ ]
         [ ]
         [ ]
```
You start in location `*`. The hallways each have a plaque the the top or left end of the hallway.

In addition, you have a waiver in your inventory, which starts:

```
MINISTRY OF PUZZLES RELATED TO THE SURNAMES OF IMPORTANT PERSONAGES: ACCIDENT WAIVER...
```

The map forms a crossword, the answers of which are last names of interactive fiction authors. Clues are given in the plaques, and the first letter of the game is given in the hallway letter.

- C, Colossal Cave Adventure, Crowther
- D, Dunnet, Schnell
- H, Hobbit, Megler
- F, 1893: A World's Fair Mystery, Nepstad
- P, Planetfall, Meretzky
- I, Inform 7, Nelson
- A, Anchorhead, Gentry
- M, Amnesia, Ditsch
- Z, Zork, Lebling
- G, Galatea, Short

The filled-out crossword becomes

![Crossword solution](https://files.ircpuzzles.org/2024/a1-crossword-answers.png)

Read in order the dot, line, triangle, square, and pentagon (1, 2, 3, 4, 5). This spells out the answer, 'prose'.

Hint(s):

- <span class="hint">Think out of the box</span>
- <span class="hint">clue is not in base64</span>
- <span class="hint">yet</span>
- <span class="hint">"Watch what everyone else does ..."</span>

<details><summary>Answer</summary>
    The password to #ircpuzzles-2024-afpc-A5 was "squeamishossifrage"
</details>

<details markdown="1"><summary>Walkthrough</summary>

The text given looks like base-64, but actually can't be *decoded* as anything interesting using base64.

Instead if you *encode* it in base-64, you get the message `THE2MmM4aG1CWWordSs1NkRYPT0=`, or "the two magic words in crypto".

The answer is the ciphertext of a [1977 RSA challenge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magic_Words_are_Squeamish_Ossifrage), "The Magic Words are Squeamish Ossifrage".

The key is 'SqueamishOssifrage'.

### Level A5, *The Afterparty* by za3k

Theme: Space

Clue(s):

- 
    Hey, glad you could make it. Bacchus's afterparty has everything. Half of Bacchus‚Äôs hot nurses just showed up from another party! The musician was pretty famous but he left without his instrument. I hear that chick over there is some kind of royalty in Ancient Ethiopia, she‚Äôs been bragging about her kid for hours. Wait, I know you. What was your name again?

    Who came doesn‚Äôt matter. Who (and what) is still at the party?

Hint(s):

- <span class="hint">The answer is your name</span>
- <span class="hint">Constellations</span>
- <span class="hint">Story: A priest came earlier chanting latin, real old-school fundamentalist type. But Bacchus kicked him out. Took his cross and burned his bible too. I know the guy was a party pooper but geez, you know?</span>
- <span class="hint">It‚Äôs not a group, it‚Äôs a sequence. What order did they show up in? Make a list. [The narrator is not in the list]</span>
- <span class="hint">Story: Before that, some huge guy tracked down the party, but he left after he got really drunk and his pants fell down.</span>
- <span class="hint">Story: Before that this cute lil dog showed up, he's asleep in the corner.</span>
- <span class="hint">Story: The first person to the party was a little bear, but with real Alpha vibes, you know?</span>
- <span class="hint">Once you know the pattern, you can reasonably guess each new partygoer from the one before.</span>

<details><summary>Answer</summary>
    The password to #ircpuzzles-2024-afpc-A6 was "orion"
</details>

<details markdown="1"><summary>Walkthrough</summary>

The key insight in this puzzle was to make a list of everything still at the party, in the order it arrived:

1. a small alpha bear (a little bear, but with real Alpha vibes)
2. a small dog (this cute lil dog)
3. a belt (some huge guy tracked down the party, but he left after he got really drunk and his pants fell down)
4. a cross (A priest came earlier chanting latin, real old-school fundamentalist type. But Bacchus kicked him out. Took his cross and burned his bible too.)
5. an Ancient Ethiopian queen (that chick over there is some kind of royalty in Ancient Ethiopia, she‚Äôs been bragging about her kid for hours)
6. a musician's instrument (The musician was pretty famous but he left without his instrument)
7. Half of Bacchus‚Äôs hot nurses
8. You, the answer to the puzzle

The party guests are constellations:

1. Polaris (Alpha Ursae Minoris) - a little bear with alpha vibes
2. Canis Minor - a little dog
3. Orion‚Äôs Belt - a giant tracker‚Äôs belt
4. Southern/Latin Cross (Crux) - a cross
5. Cassiopeia - Ancient Ethiopian royalty
6. Lyra - a musician‚Äôs instrument
7. Pleiades - half of bachus‚Äôs nursemaids, the Nysiads

Polaris has one star, Canis Minor two stars, and so on up to the seven stars of the Pleiades. 

You are the most famous constellation with eight stars, Orion, back for your missing belt.

The answer is 'orion'.

<details markdown="1"><summary>Walkthrough</summary>

The video appears to be static, but only certain pixels change. Staring at the outline or using an image diff tool, it's possible to see this shape:

![static](https://files.ircpuzzles.org/2024/YGKlWVgae1QUX.png)

Viewing the image at extreme angles, the shapes flatten into the words:

- April
- 21
- MMVII
- Bhutan

On April 21, 2007, Bhutan held a [practice election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_Bhutanese_National_Assembly_election#National_mock_election) to teach people how democracy works, before their first real election.

The answer was 'mockelection'.

### Level A7, *The Spiral* by pavonia

Theme: Historic Personalities

Clue(s): 

- Roses are amber, violets are blue, don't be a Sherlock to unsnarl the clew!
- [website](https://ircp.link/EGTAnV)

Hint(s):

- <span class="hint">#FACADE</span>
- <span class="hint">hex colors point to puzzle topic</span>
- <span class="hint">colors are colors, nothing hidden within them</span>
- <span class="hint">one circle, one base</span>
- <span class="hint">ph < 7 & strands</span>
- <span class="hint">fill 'em out</span>

<details><summary>Answer</summary>
    The password to #ircpuzzles-2024-afpc-A8 was "emmanuellecharpentier"
</details>

<details markdown="1"><summary>Walkthrough</summary>

Several hints should point the player to the relation to molecular biology:

- the spiral resembling a strand of RNA;
- the colors in the initial clue pointing to the hex colors in the HTML code, namely *amber*, *ochre*, *opal* and *umber*, which stand for the three RNA/DNA [stop codons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_codon);
- the hint ‚Äúdon‚Äôt be a Sherlock‚Äù pointing to James Watson.

Each ‚Äúpearl‚Äù in the spiral represents one [base](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleobase) in the RNA strand, where the HTML element class names give hints on how to map element colors to complementary base pairs (A, A inverted = U; C, C inverted = G). Reading the strand in standard 5-to-3-end direction yields:

> (5) UUYAUMUUA <span style="color:blue">AUG<span style="text-decoration:underline">GCBUGGGCDMGRGAC</span>UGA</span> CAYGC <span style="color:blue">AUG<span style="text-decoration:underline">GAAGAYAUMACSAUUAACGGV</span>UAG</span> AC <span style="color:blue">AUG<span style="text-decoration:underline">UGYMGGAUWUCKCCHMGA</span>UAA</span> UAUUUUAACGUUU (3)
> 
> (significant parts in blue, actual message parts underlined).

There are three significant substrings, each starting with an AUG triplet ([start codon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Start_codon)) and ending with one of the three triplets for [stop codons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_codon).

Beside the specific bases A, C, G and U there are some parts of the string given as [degenerate base symbols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid_notation) which represent several bases. The player has to replace those by matching concrete bases.

Translating all significant substrings of base triples [into amino acids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_and_RNA_codon_tables) and taking their single-letter short codes gives the three words ‚ÄúAWARD‚Äù, ‚ÄúEDITING‚Äù and ‚ÄúCRISPR‚Äù, hinting to Nobel Prize winner Emmanuelle Charpentier (together with Jennifer Doudna) for the CRISPR gene editing technique.

If read in the wrong direction, the string starts with the message "FAIL&lt;stop&gt;".

The answer is 'EmmanuelleCharpentier'.

<details><summary>Answer</summary>
    The password to #ircpuzzles-2024-afpc-B2 was "infinitylupin"
</details>

<details markdown="1"><summary>Walkthrough</summary>

The game was similar to tetris, with pentominos (5-square tiles) instead of 4-square tiles. The same tiles always fell each game, in a repeating loop.

[Pentominos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentomino) have a couple standard naming schemes.

![Naming Scheme](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/69/Pentomino_Naming_Conventions.svg/1024px-Pentomino_Naming_Conventions.svg.png)

According to one common scheme, the tiles falling are called: I, N, F, I, N, I, T, Y, L, U, P, I, N, (repeats)

The answer was 'infinitylupin'. ([lupin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lupinus) is a flower)

The letters of ank»Ø√∂\_eidmc can be unscrambled to read k»Ønami\_c√∂de.

The [konami code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konami_Code), popularized by Contra, is a common cheat code. In Contra it gave you 30 extra lives. The code is 11 key presses: Up, U, Down, Down, Left, Right, Left, Right, B, A, Start.

11 keys is the same length as `k»Ønami\_c√∂de`.

### Level B3, *Thor's Puzzle* by pavonia

Theme: Mythology

Clue(s):

- [image](https://ircp.link/5hI9Sm)

Hint(s): 

- <span class="hint">Spot 'em</span>
- <span class="hint">Each panel has one</span>
- <span class="hint">·ö†·ö¢·ö¶·õÖ·ö±·ö¥</span>
- <span class="hint">Younger</span>
- <span class="hint">Ignore the confused old man</span>

<details><summary>Answer</summary>
    The password to #ircpuzzles-2024-afpc-B4 was "darksamus"
</details>

<details markdown="1"><summary>Walkthrough</summary>

Note: The puzzle was created in [Brick Link](https://www.bricklink.com/v3/studio/download.page)

The puzzler is presented with a comic story about a young Thor and his lively day. In each panel scene, one norse Futhark rune is hidden.

The hidden runes are from the long-branch Younger Futhark alphabet, which can be concluded from the ·õÖ rune in scenes 2 and 6 which is only available in this specific runes alphabet. The theme also gives a hint, as long branch runes were primarily used in Denmark.

In the scenes the following runes occur in order:
1. A ·õè rune is formed by the ducklings in front of Thor taking a bath.
2. Thor is engraving an ·õÖ into the runestone behind the school class.
3. The weapons on the ground form a ·ö± next to the fighting arena.
One of the posts of the shed behind the pizza baking place looks like a ·ö¥.
4. The path in the middle of the garden has a ·õã-shape
5. There‚Äôs an ·õÖ in the pattern of the floor in front of the safe.
6. The tree on the right looks like a big ·õò.
7. Thor and Sif are watching a bunch of dragons forming an ·ö¢.
8. Another ·õã can be found in the shining stars between the alien and Thor.

Combining the runes gives ‚Äú·õè·õÖ·ö±·ö¥·õã·õÖ·õò·ö¢·õã‚Äù = ‚ÄúDarkSamus‚Äù, one of the main antagonists from the Metroid video game series.

The answer is 'DarkSamus'.

Reading the message top-to-bottom, and splitting sections at ‚îä, we see:

Decoding the ciphertext section using a [Vigen√®re](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigen%C3%A8re_cipher) cipher and the 6-letter key NIONSO (or ONIONS), we get this message (splitting at ‚∏±):

</details>

<details markdown="1"><summary>Walkthrough</summary>

The first two blocks of letters hint to the Jupiter-C rocket numbering cipher, where the letters **HUNTSVILEX** map to the digits **1234567890**.

Replacing all letters by their corresponding digit gives 10 integer values:

> <span style="text-decoration:line-through">12345 67890</span> 03662 16479 12817 32958 09155 07324 34789 29296 27465 36620

 The player is supposed to find that all of them have a common prime factor of 1831.

Dividing all numbers by 1831 yields a series of numbers representing a letter of the alphabet each (1 = A, 2 = N etc.), giving the string ‚Äúbigredspot‚Äù.

Combining those three hints (Jupiter + 1831 + big red spot) points to Heinrich Schwabe who made the first detailed drawings of Jupiter‚Äôs Great Red Spot.

The answer is 'HeinrichSchwabe'.

The video was an animated autostereogram (magic eye). If you've never viewed one, try facing the screen head on, and slightly crossing your eyes as it plays. A three-dimensional "cutout" may appear as you watch. Some fraction of people cannot view autostereograms. Some solvers instead used computer autostereogram decoders on screenshots.

The (non-autostereogram) video was provided as the final hint: https://ircp.link/IDkbp0

The video is *Bad Apple*, a fan video for the Touhou Project series of bullet hell games.

The key is "badapple".

</details>

<details markdown="1"><summary>Walkthrough</summary>

J√∂r√∞ is the personification of earth in Norse mythology, so from context (J√∂r√∞ is the mother of Thor from Lego puzzle part 1, ‚Äúsecret addendum‚Äù and reference to Braille runes puzzle) the player has to conclude that [cipher runes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cipher_runes) are hidden in the flower pots and beds grown by J√∂r√∞ in scene 5 of the earlier Lego puzzle.

![Jord's Garden](https://files.ircpuzzles.org/2024/9p7elPJN76.jpg)

Each flower pot/bed grows flowers with two different blossom colors (light and dark). The number of blossoms for each color encodes the cipher runes (light color = ‚Äúaett‚Äù, dark color = position in aett).

Starting at the top of the scene, going clockwise, the cipher runes are

> 1/2, 3/5, 2/4, 1/1, 1/1, 2/4, 2/1, 1/4, 2/3, 3/3.

Translating to Younger Futhark runes (as used in the first Lego puzzle part) with the usual first/third aett flipped using the translation table

|                                      | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |
|--------------------------------------|---|---|---|---|---|---|

|aett 2 ( two white/yellow flowers )   | ·öº | ·öæ | ·õÅ | ·õÖ | ·õã |   |
|aett 1 ( one white/yellow flower )    | ·õè | ·õí | ·õò | ·õö | ·õ¶ |   |

gives the word ‚Äú·õí·ö±·õÖ·õè·õè·õÖ·öº·õö·õÅ·ö¶‚Äù = ‚ÄúBrattahl√≠√∞‚Äù, a [former settlement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brattahl%C3%AD%C3%B0) of Erik the Red on Greenland.

The answer is 'brattahlid'

The clue is a recursive, fractal maze (credit to Mark J.P. Wolf).

The solution is to chart a path through the maze, which starts at (full-size) Link and ends at (full-size) Zelda. The sword starts at 3, and this number gets multiplied by 3 or increased by 1 as you pass different NPCs.

Here is one of the two common solutions:
