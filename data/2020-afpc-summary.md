Here are the puzzles, hints, and answers for the 2020 April Fools Puzzle Contest on #ircpuzzles on libera IRC.
Hints were gradually revealed throughout the contest. Expect to need them to finish.

### Level 0

Clue(s):

- V2VEb250TGV0Q09WSUQxOVJ1aW5BRlA= 
- Except for Level 01, all spaces are to be replaced with "_" (no quotes)

<details><summary>Answer</summary>
    The solution was: "WeDontLetCOVID19RuinAFP".
</details>

<details markdown="1"><summary>Walkthrough</summary>

The solution is to decode the [base64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64), for example with the Linux command `base64 -d`.

### Level 1, by pavonia

Clue(s):

- Q'bu!

Hint(s):

- <span class="hint">Qb guvf!</span>
- <span class="hint">cbq onl qbbef</span>
- <span class="hint">a = n</span>
- <span class="hint">every long journey begins with the first 1852 metres</span>

<details><summary>Answer</summary>
    The solution was: "Bqlffrl".
</details>

<details markdown="1"><summary>Walkthrough</summary>
	
As hinted by `a = n` and `Qb guvf!`, the first step is to run the clue through [ROT13](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROT13):

> D'oh!

Hinting at Homer Simpson.

Homer hints at Homer's Odyssey. `cbq onl qbbef` becomes "pod bay doors", hinting at "2001: A Space Odyssey".

"Odyssey" ROT13'd is the answer, `Bqlffrl`.

</details>

</details>

<details markdown="1"><summary>Walkthrough</summary>

These are [Pythagorean triples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_triple).

The oldest list of such triples is [Plimpton 322](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plimpton_322).

</details>

The answer is `Atlantis`.

</details>

### Level 4, by simplexish

Clue(s):

- [image #1](https://files.ircpuzzles.org/2020/qV7d2Zz.png)
- Archivist's note: This puzzle contains errors. I recommend reading the first three hints.

Hint(s):

- <span class="hint">Goddess of beauty is hint for all the cells </span>
- <span class="hint">[image #1 v2](https://files.ircpuzzles.org/2020/YBiZWa2.png)</span>
- <span class="hint">[image #1 v3](https://files.ircpuzzles.org/2020/E4l60xO.png)</span>

- <span class="hint">double whammy</span>

<details><summary>Answer</summary>
    The solution was: "Freyja_Prende".
</details>

<details markdown="1"><summary>Walkthrough</summary>

![solutions](https://files.ircpuzzles.org/2020/level04-solved.png)

One slot could hold two answers. Combine them for the password, `Freyja_Prende`.

Archivist's notes on possible errors:

- Xochipilli is male.
- The only reference to the Hausa Zamani I found is https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_love_and_lust_deities. It claims Zamani is male.
- It is unclear that Bastet and Qetesh are beauty goddesses.

</details>

### Level 5, by pavonia

Clue(s):

- Œ°Œë¬∑ŒüŒó¬∑Œ°ŒôŒë¬∑ŒüŒí¬∑Œ°ŒôŒí¬∑ŒûŒò¬∑Œ†Œì¬∑Œ°ŒôŒî¬∑Œ°Œë¬∑Œ†

Hint(s):

- <span class="hint">The answer is between ŒûŒï and Œ°ŒöŒí</span>
- <span class="hint">STX ETX</span>

<details><summary>Answer</summary>
    The solution was "Kore".
</details>

<details markdown="1"><summary>Walkthrough</summary>

All the symbols (some look like english) are uppercase greek letters.

The solution is to interpret the letters as [Greek/Ionic numerals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_numerals)

This gives the numeric values: `101-78-111-72-112-69-83-114-101-80`

Interpreted as ascii byte values, this reads: `eNoHpESreP`. Or backwards, `PerSEpHoNe`.

Another name for Persephone is `Kore`.

Hints:

- The answer is between 65 and 122 (`A` and `z` in ASCII). Hints at greek numerals and readable ASCII text.
- STX ETX. ASCII control codes for "start of text" and "end of text". Hints at ASCII encoding.

</details>

### Level 6, by simplexish

Clue(s):

- [audio](https://files.ircpuzzles.org/2020/level6.wav)

Hint(s):

- <span class="hint">number</span>

<details><summary>Answer</summary>
    The solution was "42".
</details>

<details markdown="1"><summary>Walkthrough</summary>

Morse dits and dahs are: `__ ._ _.__ ._ ___... / .... / ..`

In international morse (ITU) this might read `MAYA: / H / I`

But actually, everything after the colon (`.... ..`) is [maya numerals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_numerals), not morse.

The answer is simply `42`.

</details>

### Level 7, by pavonia

Clue(s):

- [text](https://files.ircpuzzles.org/2020/level07.txt)

<details><summary>Answer</summary>
    The solution was "Merytre_Hatshepsut"
</details>

<details markdown="1"><summary>Walkthrough</summary>

The text is unicode symbols (white chess kings and mountain emoji) in the shape of an egyptian ankh.

Interpreting the symbols as binary (‚ôî=0,‚õ∞=1) and ignoring whitespace, we get the following bytes: `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFND5bGUYxM`

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFND5bGUYxM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFND5bGUYxM) is Mozart's "Grabmusik - KV 42 (35a)". "Grabmusik" is literally "Grave Music".
"KV42" is a [catalogue number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%B6chel_catalogue)--the catalogue is called K√∂chel Verzeichnis.

The two symbols (mountain, crown), the ankh, and the name "Grave Music" hint at the valley of the kings.

[KV42](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KV42), or King's Valley Tomb 42, was constructed for [Merytre-Hatshepsut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merytre-Hatshepsut), the wife of Pharaoh Thutmose III, although she was never buried there.

The answer is `merytre_hatshepsut`.

</details>

### Level 8, by pavonia

Clue(s):

- [image](https://files.ircpuzzles.org/2020/level08.png)

Hint(s):

- <span class="hint">John Gardner Wilkinson</span>

<details><summary>Answer</summary>
    The solution was "mutnedjmet".
</details>

<details markdown="1"><summary>Walkthrough</summary>

An image of a maze. There is only one path from the outside to the center. [Solution](https://files.ircpuzzles.org/2020/level08-solved.png)

The letters along the path spell (from outside in): `HOREMHEB`

[Horemheb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horemheb) was a pharaoh around 1319BC.

The hieroglyphs in the center of the maze are M23-N41:X1-G36:X1. They spell [hmt-nswt-wrt](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E1%B8%A5mt-nswt-wrt), "Great Royal Wife'.

Horemheb's wife was the former queen of Egypt, `mutnedjmet`.

</details>

### Level 9, by pavonia

Clue(s):

- üë®‚Äç‚ù§Ô∏è „Ä¶„Äß „Ä°„Äá„Ä§ ‚ù§Ô∏è „Ä©„Äß „Ä°‰∏Ä„Äá ‚ù§Ô∏è „Ä°„Äá„Ä£ „Ä£„Ä© ‚ù§Ô∏è „Ä°„Äá„Ä° „Ä•„Ä¢ ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüë© ([as html](https://files.ircpuzzles.org/2020/puzzle-09_9a8634a86603da37adb037f79f8cb018a0aed389ddbdda1f7a831358c825c23e.html))

<details><summary>Answer</summary>
    The solution was "Magpie_Bridge".
</details>

<details markdown="1"><summary>Walkthrough</summary>

The glyphs are [Suzhou numerals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suzhou_numerals).
    
> man ‚ù§Ô∏è 67 104 ‚ù§Ô∏è 97 110 ‚ù§Ô∏è 103 39 ‚ù§Ô∏è 102 52 ‚ù§Ô∏è woman

The decimal numbers 67-104-97-110-103-39-102-52, when decoded as ASCII read `Chang'e4`.

[Chang'e](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chang%27e) is the Chinese goddess of the moon. It's also the namesame of the Chinese Lunar Exploration Program, the most recent mission of which was Chang'e 4.

[The Cowherd and the Weaver Girl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cowherd_and_the_Weaver_Girl) is the tale of two lovers, reunited once a year by a bridge of magpies between them. It's also the name of the most recent Chinese relay satellite, part of the Chang'e 4 mission.

The answer is `Magpie_Bridge`.

</details>

### Level 10, by pavonia

Clue(s):

- [image](https://files.ircpuzzles.org/2020/level10.jpg)

<details><summary>Answer</summary>
    The solution was "Aulus_Livius_Proculus".
</details>

<details markdown="1"><summary>Walkthrough</summary>

Decoding the roman numerals, we get:

```
-- -- 15 23 14 10 15 10 <- 1
18 21  2  2  5  4 17 21 -> 10
-- -- -- -- 24  6  8 23 <- 5
```

Decoding using A=1, Z=26 we get:

```
--OWNJOJ
RUBBEDQU
----XFHW
```

Caesar shifting the first line back 1, the second forward 10, and the last back 5, we get:

> NVMINI BELLONAE SACR

A quick search shows this the the beginning of an inscription in the [Temple of Bellona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_of_Bellona,_Ostia). The reverse begins:

> A(ulus) LIVIVS PROCVLVS P(ublius) LVCILIVS GAMALA F(ilius) IIVIR PRAEF(ectus) CAESAR(is)		

That names Aulus Livius Proculus and the duovir Publius Lucilius Gamala Filius as rebuilding the temple.

Or, "A.L.P. & P.L.G.F.", the initials in the inscription.

The answer is the missing name from the image, `Aulus_Livius_Proculus`.

</details>

### Level 11, by pavonia

Clue(s):

- And Odin instructed his son to indite the Great Book of Hvatvetna, and H√∂√∞r did as he was bidden ... 1643O131425O13155226O13461643O13155226O52262553O132435O131425

Hint(s):

- <span class="hint">the one-eyed man</span>
- <span class="hint">11548-1</span>
- <span class="hint">draw a conclusion</span>

<details><summary>Answer</summary>
    The solution was "Hamskerpir".
</details>

<details markdown="1"><summary>Walkthrough</summary>

[H√∂√∞r](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%C3%B6%C3%B0r) is the blind son of Odin and Figg. He is instructed to write the book of "whatever". We have hints toward Braille (Odin with one eye, H√∂√∞r being blind). We also have hints toward historical norse writing--[Runes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elder_Futhark).

Split at each "O" to get:

> 1643 131425 13155226 13461643 13155226 52262553 132435 131425

All strings are even length. This hints at the correct interpetation as pairs:

> 16/43 13/14/25 13/15/52/26 13/46/16/43 13/15/52/26 52/26/25/53 13/24/35 13/14/25

Braille cells dots are numbered 1-3 in the first column, 3-6 in the second column. (Hinted by `11548-1`, a braille standard)

![Braille cell](https://files.ircpuzzles.org/2020/Braille_cell.svg)

We are hinted to `draw a conclusion`. `16/43` is `1->6, 4->3` or `draw a line from 1 to 6, then draw a line from 4 to 3`.

This forms 8 drawings for the 8 groups. We interpret them as [Elder Futhark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elder_Futhark) runes with some imagination.

> ·ö∑·ö®·ö±·õû·ö±·õü·ö†·ö®

Or, "gardrofa". The horses [Hamskerpir and Gar√∞rofa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamskerpir_and_Gar%C3%B0rofa) are from Norse mythology.

The answer is `hamskerpir`.

</details>

### Level 12

Clue(s):

- [image](https://files.ircpuzzles.org/2020/level12.png)

<details><summary>Answer</summary>
    The solution was "Nemontemi".
</details>

<details markdown="1"><summary>Walkthrough</summary>

The image is a [nonogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonogram).

Archivist's note: The nonogram has two solutions. Only one was intended.

You can solve by hand or use an [online solver](http://a.teall.info/nonogram/). <span style="font-size: 6pt">{"ver":[[7,1,1],[3,1,3,2],[4,1,2],[13,1],[2,1,1,2],[1,5,1,1],[1,1,1,4],[4,1,1,1,2,1],[2,1,1,2],[4,5,1,2],[1,1,2,1],[1,11],[1,1,1],[2,1,2,2],[5,1,1,4]],"hor":[[3,1,3],[4,1,1,2],[4,3,2],[12,1],[1,1,1,1],[1,1,5,2,1],[2,1,1,1,1,1],[1,1,1,1,1,2,1],[4,1,1,1,1],[1,1,5,1,2],[1,1,2],[9,1],[4,3,2,1],[2,1,1,1,1,2],[1,5,2,2]]}</span>

Decoded, it looks like:

![solved nonogram](https://files.ircpuzzles.org/2020/level12-solved.png)

Which is an [Aztec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aztec_Code) barcode.

The code reads [Nemontemi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N%C4%93mont%C4%93mi).

The answer is `nemontemi`.

</details>

### Level 13

Welcome to the end of the #ircpuzzles 2020 April Fool's Puzzle Competition!
