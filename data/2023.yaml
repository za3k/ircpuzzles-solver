    clues:
      - Solutions are not always country names 
      - |
          1) On borders both Adriatic and Ionian
             I perch, my heads opposing.
             Some may judge my looks draconian
             and the colour juxtaposing.

          2) One Seven Five Nought Eight
             Is the number of which I'm made
             Some big, some small
             Some tiny specks
             All throughout the ocean laid.

          3) Hear my name and you might think
             (correctly!) that it does derive
             from that imaginary line
             which parts another ten of us
             in kind and splits the world apart.

          4) There's many things to find on me,
             but let me be quite droll:
             A Grassy Cove,
             A Kingsley Lake,
             A Green Banana Hole.

    clues:
      - | 
            Welcome to Level 04. You're standing in the middle of the forest. There is a fork in the road. You can /join four other levels. "east" leads along a river to Level A1. "north" leads through a clearing to Level B1. You can hear birds singing in the "west". That way leads to Level C1. There is a weathered stone plinth tucked behind some shrubbery. On it, someone carved: "05: A+B+C"

            (In the interactive solver, we have automatically unlocked A1 with the password "east", B1 with the password "west", and C1 with the password "west".)

            Come back here when you have the password for 05.
